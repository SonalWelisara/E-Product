# Full-Stack Product Listing App

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project is a basic full-stack product listing application designed to allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their own products. The application also provides a public interface where all products added by any user can be viewed without requiring authentication. It's built with a strong focus on user authentication (JWT-based), product CRUD operations, and profile-based product management.

## ‚ú® Features

* **User Authentication:**
    * User signup with email and password.
    * User login with JWT tokens for secure session management.
    * User logout functionality.
    * Users can update their name and password (requires current password for verification).
* **Product Management (Authenticated Users):**
    * Users can add new products with title, description, price, and image upload.
    * Users can edit their existing products (including updating the image).
    * Users can delete their own products.
    * Product images are stored and served locally by the backend.
* **Public Product Listing:**
    * A dedicated page to view all products added by all users without requiring login.
    * Displays product image, title, price, and owner's name/email.
    * Clicking on a product navigates to a detailed product page.
* **Protected Routes:**
    * Ensures that only authenticated users can access profile and product management features.
* **Responsive UI:** Designed to be usable across various devices.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### **1. Backend Setup**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/product-listing-backend.git](https://github.com/SonalWelisara/E-Product.git)
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **PostgreSQL Database Setup:**
    * Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running on your system.
    * Create a new database for this application (e.g., `ProductListingApp`).
    * Update the `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL` in `app/database.py` with your PostgreSQL credentials:
        ```python
        SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://user:password@host:port/ProductListingApp"
        ```
5.  **Run the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The backend API will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### **2. Frontend Setup**

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install # or yarn install or pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Run the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev # or yarn dev or pnpm dev
    ```
    The frontend application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
